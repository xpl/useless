They hold DOM references and bound events, so one needs\n    to properly free those resources during deinitialization. Case studies:\n\n    -   For example, a pop-up menu could render itself into top-level 'document' element, \n        so just by destroying its parent component's DOM, things created by this pop-up\n        wont be destroyed, and that's why explicit 'destroy' method is needed. With\n        Component, you call 'destroy' on parent component, and it propagates to child\n        components automatically, triggering their 'destroy' methods.\n\n    -   A component could dynamically bind to other components with help of $bindable and\n        $trigger facilities. If such component gets destroyed, those links became invalid\n        and should be removed, otherwise it's considered as 'memory leak'. Component handles\n        such situation, removing those links if any involved component gets destroyed.\n\n    Component could be considered as basic tool for dynamic code binding at macro level,\n
